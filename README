# vlc-Conductor : that's it! conduct vlc to do yo biding!
############################################

After aquiring a free Kinect Sensor from the Imagine Cup Finals this Year (2011),
having failed to win / buy me an Xbox 360, I decided to settle for nothing less!

So, I set out to use my Kinect to give me a superior entertainment experience via VLC
by enabling me to control my music - play, pause, volume+/-, next/prev, etc via the 
newly acquired toy.

Using the skills learnt from Clint Rutkas, I put together something called vlcconductor, n IT WORKS!

Though, u might have to check the code n tweak a bit (mapping your VLC global-keyhooks to gestures in the callbacks)

Or soon I'll post the default keystroke-gesture mappings,and some docs too.

NOTE : the "VLCkonductor1.0" folder contains the Windows MSI files -  the generated installer
